EGS is a GNU AGPL Erlang Game Server for the game Phantasy Star Universe: AOTI.

This is a community effort toward reviving the now dead western PC servers.
Ultimately the goal is to provide common components for instanced action
RPG game servers, by providing facilities to handle characters, items,
communication aspects, and more. A later goal could be to research a new
and optimized protocol and build an associated client.

This is a very early work in progress. It does not include any data files
yet, meaning one cannot at this point run a server without using the
proprietary files from AOTI.

The server requires Erlang R14B to compile and run.

Use 'make' to compile, 'make run' to run and 'make fclean' to cleanup.
