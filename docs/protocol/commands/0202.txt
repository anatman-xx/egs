SessionID: like GID except typically only temporary; apparently official use the same counter for NPCs and for these SessionID
0:1024: can also contain an error message, though details are limited on that; it's similar to 0223 though

The following format will display an error:
	0:32, 3:32/little, 0:48, Len:16/little, Error/binary, 0:Padding

The server should disconnect the client right after sending that command if an error has been sent.
